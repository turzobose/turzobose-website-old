I write about different algorithms, approaches and differences in frameworks etc in my blog. Projects done on Object Detection and segmentation, model training and tuning with Pytorch and Tensorflow with Visualization can be viewed at the Projects tab. I love travelling, exploring new cultures and cuisines. Some of my travel stories can be found on the Travels page.
